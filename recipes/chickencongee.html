    <h2>Easy meal prep</h2>
    <p>I'm lazy and I buy a ton of chicken thigh from costco at a time. They are packaged in groups of 3 or 4 thighs and it takes forever to thaw them. This is an easy way to quickly produce like 5 servings of food from a block of chicken ice. </p>
    <p>I used to do this in an instapot but then my instapot broke. I used to think instapots are great until mine broke. Turned out that a little part of its circuit board essentially disconnected the computer from the entire heating apparatus. If i had a soldering kit I could try to fix it but honestly unless you want to use its specific temperature control functions for like, fermenting stuff it's not that great of a product. The saute function honestly sucks. Terrible heat control.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>3-4 cups of rice</li>
        <li>As much water as can fit in your pot. Like, more than 2.5 liters</li>
        <li>generous splash of cheap soy sauce</li>
        <h4>All of the following are optional</h4>
        <li>garlic, ginger and scallions</li>
        <li>White pepper powder (but this isn't actually optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you want aromatics in there, finely dice them up. I like lots of ginger.</li>
        <li>dump everything in a pressure cooker and pressure cook it for like 20 minutes at low pressure. If your chicken is completely frozen together maybe let it sit in the hot water and separate the pieces before putting the lid on.</li>
        <li>Once you open the lid the rice should be completely cooked into a porridge and the chicken should be falling off the bone. I like to just fish out the chicken pieces, use some forks to remove the meat from the bones and return and stir the pot a bit. That ends up shredding the chicken and distributing water/rice well</li>
        <li>distribute your bounty into tupperware containers and eat it for lunch and dinner the next few days with stir-fried veggies or other quick side dishes.</li>
    </ol>
